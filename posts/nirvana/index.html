<p>The scent of teen spirit lingered in the air on that crisp Saturday night. I was hesitant as I stepped into the venue, unsure of what to expect. The opening act left with a broken guitar, but then the Nirvana Tribute band took the stage. And let me tell you, they killed it. Song after song, they nailed it. I was stationed near the bar right in the center, the perfect spot to feel the energy pulsating through the crowd. The distortion, the guitar bends, all of it was spot on, creating an immersive experience.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/gigs/nirvana/nirvana2.jpeg" alt="Nirvana Tribute view from bar to stage"></p>
<p>I was transported back to simpler times, a time when people cared less and life was a bit more raw. I lost myself in the music, jumping, shouting, and singing as if I were a wild man reliving my younger days.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/gigs/nirvana/nirvana3.jpeg" alt="Nirvana Tribute"></p>
<p>My attempt at a selfie captured mostly my bald head and the light beams bouncing off the smooth surface, but hey, that&rsquo;s just me being me.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/gigs/nirvana/nirvana4.jpeg" alt="Nirvana Tribute"></p>
<p>The show ended too soon, I was just getting warmed up by the time it was all over. But if they ever come back to town, you can bet I&rsquo;ll be there. Walking home that night, all my worries and stress melted away, left behind in that nirvana-filled room.</p>
