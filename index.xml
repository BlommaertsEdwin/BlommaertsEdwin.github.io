      <description>Well, what a year this has been. My daughter turned six. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe how fast she&amp;rsquo;s growing. I can still vividly remember being able to hold her in one arm, the palm of my hand cradling her little head. Now she&amp;rsquo;s putting on children&amp;rsquo;s makeup and talking about boys that kissed her.
I&amp;rsquo;m now also single. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see that one coming at the start of the year, but here we are.</description>

      <description>Using my partner&amp;rsquo;s Wacom Bamboo drawing pad, I went to work creating some bushes and a palisade, also known as a stake wall. At first, I used GIMP, and would make a drawing and then convert it to pixel art. That did not work well as the Jpeg came out all blurred. I then decided to use a program I had purchased a long time ago called Aseprite. After watching a few Youtube videos and picking up some hints and tips.</description>

      <title>I created a Tree!</title>

      <description>I was tired of seeing my little man running around stark naked without anywhere to hide behind. So I created a tree for him. Using Y-sort, collision shapes, and static bodies, I made it possible for him to go behind the tree but not go through it.
Behold my creation!

      <description>As part of my do something every day, I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a quick placeholder start screen of my game. Here is my little Frankenstein&amp;rsquo;s monster and, just like its name partner, it is ugly to look at but, it is alive!

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get the new year off to a good start with some personal goals:
 Get back into running, with the goal being, getting back to where I was two years ago. I want to run 5k in under 30 minutes and run 21k. I want to make progress on my game project EVERY DAY, as small or as big and, whatever it is, as long as it&amp;rsquo;s something. Have a finished game by the end of the year, playable with a game loop, published, and asking feedback.</description>

      <description>I thoroughly enjoyed gaming with my friends today. Even though I was pretty tired and had a head full of worries, just hearing them laugh and enjoy the game I was running for them cheered me up. The only thing missing to improve the atmosphere was some music and sound effects. I plan to add this to the next session by using a discord bot and Syrinscape. Additionally, I have a few ideas that I would like to try out in terms of the story.</description>

      <description>I had previously already added unit tests to my game. There&amp;rsquo;s already a fair few youtube videos and guides out there describing how to do this. What I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of is that it is actually particularly easy to setup godot automated testing (GUT) upon pushing code into github using github actions.
 Log into you github account and create a new action workflow.    Then add the following at the bottom of the blank.</description>

      <title>Dungeon Delver</title>

      <description>What is Dungeon Delver?    Some time ago I was introduced to Godot by a colleague. Godot is an Open Source game engine with the built-in scripting language GDscript being very similar to Python. Over a weekend, I decided to download the engine and give it a go. I enjoyed how the engine structures components and how there is a friendly community surrounding it. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before I had the idea of building a top-down action role-playing game.</description>

      <description>What is Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons: Curse Of Strahd?    It is a D&amp;amp;D tabletop RPG game, it is me and some long terms friends who roll some dice and act out various characters going through an adventure together. We do stupid and silly stuff, drink a few beers and enjoy ourselves. We decided to record it and just share it with everyone interested. I know there&amp;rsquo;s still a taboo and stigma that hangs around playing these types of games.</description>
