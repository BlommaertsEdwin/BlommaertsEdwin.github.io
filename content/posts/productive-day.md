Today was a very productive day, I managed to map all the development tasks for a project into Trello. At first I wanted to add custom fields to the Trello task card but I found a plugin that allowed me to couple a Gantt chart to the board. By doing this it added many more fields that I would have needed. Like for example, start-date, end-date, duration, previous task, following task, etc... This allowed me to set the duration of each task and  sequence in which I would work on them. Which in turn allowed me to work out how much I would be able to charge for doing this project. It took a while to setup but now that I have it it will make things easier in the future.   

I did some more work on my blog and learned some more of how GoHugo static site generator works. I have to say, the documentation is pretty amazing. I googled how to change the main landing page so it would be more like an about page and <span style="color:red">[found](https://gohugo.io/templates/homepage/)</span> quickly enough what I wanted. This made it possible for me to alter the main page.

It was then that I ran into another issue. When I added another image onto my blog it was displayed upside down. I found out that certain programs actually use some sort of code inside the image to rotate the image letting the image viewers know which side it up. After some googling I found out I had to install the <span style="color:red">[imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)</span> package to flip the image to the correct side up. Which was pretty easy once I figured out the commands.

So today was a productive day and hopefully the customer appreciates the effort put into mapping the tasks and the Gantt chart.
