### Walk before we run
Lets venture out in the world of Freelancing. It's been two weeks since I dedicated some time to working on a Freelance project. So far I've had a very positive experience. Now, every time I quote a piece of work or when I'm coding, I can see how I can improve. From improving code quality, to better pricing and customer service. I specialise in coding modules for Odoo and from what I can see there is already a big market out there. However what I don't see is a lot of modules developed using a test driven methodology (TDD). When looking at the OCA I can see they have some modules that have some good test coverage, as well as a standard in code quality. So taking that on board I've decided to put my modules under exactly the same standards. I believe a high quality of code is worth the time investment. That being said I'm just starting out on this project work so lets walk before we start running.

Speaking of running the picture above was taken while I was out running in the Ollerton Pit Woods. For me it symbolises the long road ahead and how far I still have to go. But at least, the sun is shining and the temperature is currently very agreeable.

### The first ever offer
Yes I will dome some shameless self promoting here! I've created my first offer for people looking to work with Odoo. http://www.peopleperhour.com/hourlie/setup-and-config-odoo-community-edition-v13/582429 I am pretty excited about it. I do think three days is a long time but I would rather be sure I can deliver on time and to a high standard and deliver on the date I say I will deliver. I do think I will be able to expand on the service by providing a complete CI environment with it, so developers can hit the ground running. I think it would be good basing this off the OCA current work methodology.
