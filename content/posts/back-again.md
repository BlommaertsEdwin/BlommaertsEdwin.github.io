# Here we go again
After two weeks and some change I've picked up running again. I feel that actually did my body a wealth of good. It's hard to fit in the running around a very busy family and work life but I have to do this. Since I picked up running I feel better mentally and physically. It's so easy to slide back into an old routine, especially when time is so precious and needs to be spent well if you have a lot on.

I'm going to attempt to log my run as part of my blog. Just for me and anyone else who fancies having a read. I think it's a good time to start doing this as I feel kind of fresh and relaxed after the two weeks off.

# Run 42 - 10k tempo run

Weather
:  I went out thinking it was going to be pretty cold, but it really wasn't. There was almost no wind and it was really nice running weather. Not too hot and not too cold.

Breathing
:  This was interesting, I felt like my lungs had to get used again to taking in big gulps of air. I felt it slightly during the run but it dissipated the further I ran. It might also have had something to do with the nasty head cold I generously donated by my little princess. It's something to watch for sure.

How I felt
:  I did not do a warm up... I know it was bad of me, I should have done some dynamic stretches and get my legs warmed up as well as my muscles streched especially after sitting at a desk all day. Next time for sure. I think this was the reason it took a while for me legs to feel normal for running. At first they felt pretty heavy and not in the mood for running. That wore off after 3k into the run. But I did feel great! I thought I would be worse off after taking some time off but it was still there. 

Injuries
: I had no injuries, came home feeling good!

Overall thoughts
:  Good, if there' one comment I would make is that I need to get new running shoes. I think these ones have had their time. I've done 486.6 km (291.17 miles) in them since I started using Strava, before that I ran using my Huwawei fit bit (The one where the built in GPS is 100m off each Km I run) and did couch to 5k and ran several 5k and walked a half marathon for charity. I think I've reached my 500 miles on these trainers. So I'm on the lookout now for new trainers. I also think it's time I had my gate analysed as well as my foot pronation and running style checked. The other thing I'd like to do is buy a decent running watch. One that tracks my heart beat (external HR monitor strap), has a long battery life, a decent gps, and is easy to upload to Strava.
I'd love to have a HR monitor for my long slow runs, I often run these waaay too fast and I need to monitor my HR to keep this in check. That way I get the best effect out of my LSR. Perhaps a small runners pack to store food/drink and my phone when an opportunity arrises to take some very nice pictures. Which reminds me, I'd love to run in the marshes near Hadleigh.
