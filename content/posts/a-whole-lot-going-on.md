# Good Intentions...
So, as you know, I intended to update this blog each training day with the progress of my running. As you can see, that didn't work out as well as expected. I found that I did not have the time to do these updates. There's always something else more important that comes along, work, more work, too tired, family. So I've resided to try and give a weekly update of how my running is going, especially now that I've signed up for the UK Boston Marathon. Yes, that's the United Kingdom one, not the US one! However, not only my running has taken off, but there's also a whole lot of life and work-related news. So more to come on that as well.

# Running 
A lot has been going on since last I posted. I purchased a Garmin 735xt [![Garmin 735xt](/735xt.jpg#floatright)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Garmin-Forerunner-Multisport-Running-Monitor/dp/B01DWIY3B8/ref=asc_df_B01DWIY3B8/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309950369924&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16494376877857748659&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007091&hvtargid=pla-563893630683&psc=1&th=1&psc=1) sports watch with heart rate monitor chest strap. I've been using it to do my long and easy runs within a certain heart rate zone. It helps me because I always ran my long runs way too fast, which meant I blew myself up halfway through my run. I can set workout alarms based on heart rate or pace. It's a handy tool to have as a runner. I've even configured my entire training plan and synced it to the watch. I bought it in the Black Friday sales, so I got the bundle at half price! Well worth it.

I'm very pleased with those. The people at the running shop did a gate-analysis making sure the shoe was a good fit for my feet. I've also signed myself up to the Boston Marathon. It's one of the flattest marathons around and doesn't require a ballot entry, I just signed up and was good to go. So, I'm now on a [training schedule](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=6tudajfq4gocegrtl6mgd0caj8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon) put together by someone I met through the Southend Flyers runners club and combined with a training plan from Ben Parks. Lastly, there are the long-sleeved t-shirts, running tights, and jogging bottoms that my partner gifted me on top of the shoes. I'm well and truly kitted out to take on this challenge I've set myself of running a marathon before I'm 40. 

The running itself is going very well as well, although, sitting all day does cause some stiffness in my legs, and when I go out for a run, I do feel it. I picked swimming as cross-training, and taking a break from running and doing another sport does feel rooted and enjoyable.
