# Good Intentions...
So, as you know, I intended to update this blog each training day with the progress of my running. As you can see, that didn't work out as expected. I found I simply don't have time to do these updates. There's always something else more important that comes along, work, more work, too tired, family, etc.. So I've resided to try and give a weekly update of how my running is going. Especially now I've signed up for the UK Boston Marathon. Yes that's the United Kingdom one, not the US one! Of course not only has my running taken off, there's a whole lot of other stuff life and work related that's taken off. So more to come on that as well.

# Running 
A lot has been going on since last I posted. I purchased a Garmin 735xt [![Garmin 735xt](/735xt.jpg#floatright)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Garmin-Forerunner-Multisport-Running-Monitor/dp/B01DWIY3B8/ref=asc_df_B01DWIY3B8/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309950369924&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16494376877857748659&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007091&hvtargid=pla-563893630683&psc=1&th=1&psc=1) sports watch with heart reate monitor chest strap. I've been using it to do my long and easy runs within a certain heartrate zone. It helps me because I always ran my long runs waaay too fast which meant I blew myself up half way through my run. I can set workout alarms based of heartrate or pace. It's a handy tool to have as a runner. I've even configured my entire training plan and synced it to the watch. I bought it in the Black Friday sales so got the bundle at half price! Well worth it.

I'm very pleased with those. Additionally, they did a gate analysis looking at my ankles and they're hitting the ground straight on, so, that's good as well. But, we're not done yet, I signed myself up to the Boston Marathon, it's one of the flatest marathons around and doesn't require a balot entry. I just signed up and was good to go. So, I'm now on a [training schedule](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=6tudajfq4gocegrtl6mgd0caj8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon) put together by someone I met through the Southend Flyers runners club and combined with a training plan from Ben Parks. Lastly there's the long sleeved t-shirts, running tights and jogging bottoms that my partner gifted me on top of the shoes. I'm well and truely kitted out to take on this challenge I've set myself of running a marathon before I'm 40. 

The running itself is going very well as well, although, sitting all day does cause some stifness  in my legs before I
