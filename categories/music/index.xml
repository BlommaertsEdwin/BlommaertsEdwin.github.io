      <description>Such an epic evening. First we trash out to Municipal Waste and then we dive into Cannibal Corpse. To end the vening with an adventure with three other metal heads who couldn&amp;rsquo;t get to Stratford because of closed lines. Five busses and a car journey later we got home, otherwise it would have been an expensive cab journey home or a long wait for the train. Thanks again boys, you saved the night and it was epic getting to know you.</description>

      <description>After a long train journey in which I drained my phone battery to about 36%, I arrived about an hour early at the O2 Shepherd&amp;rsquo;s Bush Empire venue and was surprised to find a sloppy long winding queue in an alley down the side of the building. With some difficulty, I was able to find where I could join in. The weather was crisp but not cold and there was a nice atmosphere.</description>
