      <description>After very little thought I went with Notion.so for my dev board. I&amp;rsquo;ve made the task Kanban board public so you can see but not edit it.
Today I&amp;rsquo;ve added an inventory screen with stackable items and item count. In the small video, you can see the max stack count is 5. So items can only be stacked up to 5 before a new stack is added to the inventory screen.</description>

      <description>While listening to Sir Patrick Steward divulge his memoir on Spotify. I hack away at my silly game.
Firstly I need to key in the attacking animation for each direction. This was fairly easy as it just meant adjusting hr Frame Coords. Next, I&amp;rsquo;m going to hook these animations in the Left Mouse button click. which again was fairly easy as I captured the input and gave a signal to the State Machine to travel to the attack state.</description>

      <description>Right, made some more progress with the animation tree and hooking that into the state machine. I would also need a place to store ideas and tasks I need to work on. I&amp;rsquo;ve got the character in a decent state but there are a few improvements I would like to add, but don&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with that just yet. So some sort of list would be nice.
I had to register if the right mouse button was held down as a separate variable.</description>

      <description>Cracking on with the game. Looks like the pre-generated code for a CharacterBody2d is actually for a side scroller. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll use a state machine for the player character so we can control animations or other game functions by looking at what state the character is in.
I&amp;rsquo;ve done some research since my last post. I&amp;rsquo;ve come across this StateChart plugin for Godot. I thought it might be handy for my players and enemies.</description>

      <description>Right, time to crack on with this characters. I&amp;rsquo;ve loaded the sprite sheet into the Sprite2D node by dragging it over the Texture field. Now it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of figuring out how many H- and Vframes are in the animation, additionally, I need to figure out the frame coordinates.
I set the Scale to x 1 and y 1 but to do this I had to unlink them, then set the values then relink them again.</description>

      <title>Picking up Godot4 again</title>

      <description>Starting over    New beginings    With the help of my previously written code, I&amp;rsquo;m starting over. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to just take my old project and build on that. I think it&amp;rsquo;s better to pick the good bits out of what I&amp;rsquo;ve written already. I&amp;rsquo;d like to make it more modular so I can share this with other communities.
Character    Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the main character and since the main character is called Little Death let&amp;rsquo;s make it a skeleton.</description>
