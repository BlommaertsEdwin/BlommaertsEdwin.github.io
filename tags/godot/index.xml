      <description>Right, made some more progress with the animation tree and hooking that into the state machine. I would also need a place to store ideas and tasks I need to work on. I&amp;rsquo;ve got the character in a decent state but there are a few improvements I would like to add, but don&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with that just yet. So some sort of list would be nice.
I had to register if the right mouse button was held down as a separate variable.</description>

      <description>Cracking on with the game. Looks like the pre-generated code for a CharacterBody2d is actually for a side scroller. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll use a state machine for the player character so we can control animations or other game functions by looking at what state the character is in.
I&amp;rsquo;ve done some research since my last post. I&amp;rsquo;ve come across this StateChart plugin for Godot. I thought it might be handy for my players and enemies.</description>

      <description>Right, time to crack on with this characters. I&amp;rsquo;ve loaded the sprite sheet into the Sprite2D node by dragging it over the Texture field. Now it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of figuring out how many H- and Vframes are in the animation, additionally, I need to figure out the frame coordinates.
I set the Scale to x 1 and y 1 but to do this I had to unlink them, then set the values then relink them again.</description>

      <description>I had previously already added unit tests to my game. There&amp;rsquo;s already a fair few youtube videos and guides out there describing how to do this. What I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of is that it is actually particularly easy to setup godot automated testing (GUT) upon pushing code into github using github actions.
 Log into you github account and create a new action workflow.    Then add the following at the bottom of the blank.</description>
