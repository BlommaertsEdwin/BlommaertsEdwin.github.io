      <description>This is the IronlandsThe gods are many; magic is rare and dangerous. Monstrous beasts stalk the wild areas, but they can be tamed. In these lands when one lays their hand on iron and they swear into their soul it becomes a vow of solemn determination treated with the utmost gravity. The Ironsworn make a living of it. Powerful, travelled, and often gifted with magic, they journey as they please, finding those who are seeking help, or perhaps in service to their own needs.</description>
