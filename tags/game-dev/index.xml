      <description>Right, time to crack on with this characters. I&amp;rsquo;ve loaded the sprite sheet into the Sprite2D node by dragging it over the Texture field. Now it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of figuring out how many H- and Vframes are in the animation, additionally, I need to figure out the frame coordinates.
I set the Scale to x 1 and y 1 but to do this I had to unlink them, then set the values then relink them again.</description>

      <description>Starting over    New beginings    With the help of my previously written code, I&amp;rsquo;m starting over. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to just take my old project and build on that. I think it&amp;rsquo;s better to pick the good bits out of what I&amp;rsquo;ve written already. I&amp;rsquo;d like to make it more modular so I can share this with other communities.
Character    Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the main character and since the main character is called Little Death let&amp;rsquo;s make it a skeleton.</description>

      <description>Using my partner&amp;rsquo;s Wacom Bamboo drawing pad, I went to work creating some bushes and a palisade, also known as a stake wall. At first, I used GIMP, and would make a drawing and then convert it to pixel art. That did not work well as the Jpeg came out all blurred. I then decided to use a program I had purchased a long time ago called Aseprite. After watching a few Youtube videos and picking up some hints and tips.</description>

      <description>I was tired of seeing my little man running around stark naked without anywhere to hide behind. So I created a tree for him. Using Y-sort, collision shapes, and static bodies, I made it possible for him to go behind the tree but not go through it.
Behold my creation!

      <description>As part of my do something every day, I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a quick placeholder start screen of my game. Here is my little Frankenstein&amp;rsquo;s monster and, just like its name partner, it is ugly to look at but, it is alive!
